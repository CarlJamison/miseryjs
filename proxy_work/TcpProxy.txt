Simple TCP port forwarder over websockets:
- Traffic flows from LEFT TO RIGHT
  -- But Websocket traffic flows from RIGHT TO LEFT
- Server side written in NodeJS, agent side written in C#
- Support forwarding only one host:port (TCP Socket)
  -- Hardcode as 127.0.0.1:445 for now, fix later
- Requires bi-directional send/recv
- Requires 4 functions on BOTH sides:
  -- TCP connect    (Hello! I would like to connect and start a session)
  -- TCP send       (Send outgoing data to the other side)
  -- TCP recv       (Process incoming data from the other side)
  -- TCP diconnect  (The connection has been ended, please inform the the other side to close their socket as well. Goodbye!)
